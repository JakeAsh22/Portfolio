      <h2>About me:</h2>
      <p>Hello, my name is Jake Ash! I am a 21 year old who has moved to Seattle from Virginia to pursure a career in web development.  One reason why I moved across the country for Epicodus, is because I have a family friend who   completed the Portland class.  He had so many great things to say about the class, that I knew it would be a great fit for me.  Besides this class, I have programmed for 3 years in highschool, and one year in college. I have always loved the challenge of coding, and how there are multiple ways to solve one problem. This flexibility lets me express myself in ways other career paths would not even dream of. So far, I have loved the class and my fellow students, who are all just as hard working as I am.</p>
